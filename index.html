        <h1 style="color: black;">Fundementals of a Scripting Language</h1>
    <div class="col s12 ">
    <p class="z-depth-4">
    The scripting language is what we use when we code the different areas of a webpage.
                
    For example the CSS script used for the style of a page is done using Java Script. This is able to handle what happens on the webpage such as event handling. For example, when you click on a nutton it will change how it looks, making it look as if it had been pushed down by a finger and when you release the button it pops back into its original position.</br></br>
        
    Scripting languages can also be used to set up buttons or interactions on a webpage. Scrolling down a website can be used to trigger scripts along with simply pressing a button. Sometimes not all data is readily available and needs to be added by the user. Although this only applies to more advanced custom tasks it is always good to know as these additions can always help with your website.

       <h1>The CSS Box Model</h1> 
        <div class="col s12">
        <p class="z-depth-4">The CSS Box Model reffers to how HTML elements are represented on a webpage. The box consists of the margin, the border, the padding and finally the content which is inside of the rest of the components.</br></br>
        All of the components that make up the box model are transparent with the only exception being the content on the inside. Each component of the box model can be edited using CSS, javascript and HTML inorder to add entities to them, expand or contract them and even remove their transparency, giving the component colour.
        </br></br>
        It is important that each layer of the box model is taken into consideration as they will affect how the element you want to place on a webpage is actually placed upon the website.

    <h1>How HTML Accesses CSS Files</h1> 
        <div class="col s12">
        <p class="z-depth-4">
            HTML files are able to access CSS by using line of code with tags such as href and link. </br></br>
            There are three main types of CSS style sheets. An external style sheet is a sheet which would, for example, allow for you to change the font on every page on a website using only one file such as a myStyleSheet.css as long as it was linked to each page on the website.</br></br>
            An internal style sheet is a style sheet that has its own individual style that won't be affected by the external style sheet as it isn't directly linked to it. </br></br>
            Finally, an inline style sheet is a single line that edits individual elements such as headers or paragraphs.</br></br>
            A line of code such as "link href="css/myStylesheet.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/" would be used to allow for the html file to access the style sheet set by the user.
